# TabMangler

A chrome extension that does exaclty one thing: Close exact duplicate tabs (based on tab title) when you click the extension's icon.

That's it. Doesn't count 'em, doesn't interact with the user. Doesn't error check, honey badger don't care.

Don't want to load an unpacked extension?  No worries, it's now available in the Chrome Web Store
